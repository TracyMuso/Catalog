<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [Catlog] <a name="about-project"></a>

> In this project, we have created a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you own: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data will be stored in JSON files but we also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to your program's class structure.

- Create a main.rb file that will serve as your console app entry-point.
  - Present the user with a list of options to perform.
  - Let users choose an option.
  - If needed, ask for parameters for the option.
  - Have a way to quit the app.
- The following options should be available:
  - List all books
  - List all music albums
  - List all movies
  - List of games
  - List all genres (e.g 'Comedy', 'Thriller')
  - List all labels (e.g. 'Gift', 'New')
  - List all authors (e.g. 'Stephen King')
  - List all sources (e.g. 'From a friend', 'Online shop')
  - Add a book
  - Add a music album
  - Add a movie
  - Add a game
